To interact with the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) you will need to have access to a Lotus node. An easy way to gain access to a Lotus node is to set one up on your local computer and start a local developer network. This page summarizes how to install Lotus using premade installation scripts. For more details on how to install Lotus, including steps for operating systems not listed here, [check out the official Lotus docs](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/install/prerequisites/)
