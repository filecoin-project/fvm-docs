_Actors_ are what Filecoin calls the code that runs on it's virtual machine. There are some built-in actors that have existed in Filecoin for a long time. The FVM introduces _native actors_; code that developer can write to run on-top of the Filecoin network. Native actors are similar to Ethereum's smart-contract terminology.

_Smart contracts_ are small, self-executing contracts that run on Ethereum. The term _smart contract_ is also used in other blockchains to descript the code that can run on their networks. The FVM only calls EVM-compaible contracts _smart contracts_. Other blockchains, such as Solana, have aother names in the context of the FVM.
