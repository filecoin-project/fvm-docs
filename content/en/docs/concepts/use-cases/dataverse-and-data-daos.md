With the FVM, it will be possible to write smart contracts to harvest and exchange tokens between peers for storage activities such as:

- Computation requests: Such as requests for unsealing data before retrieval or other state changes.
- Validation: Verifying that transactions are legal, not double-spends or malicious.
- Transformations: What submitted data goes through before the storage provider stores them. See [Data Representation](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-systems.filecoin_files.piece.data-representatio).
- Feature detection: Whether a browser supports a certain block of code and runs different code depending on whether it does or doesn't.
- Extraction: Of data from a source system for further use.
- Machine learning: Using data to predict outcomes...and more.

You will be able to apply a computation on data, incentivizing its execution all the way to the end, and certifying that the resulting storage state and the computation output are verifiably correct.

If you chain these processes together, you can compound the value of the datasets iteratively. You can deploy self-learning entities on-chain, like the [The Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/), to steward, maintain, and curate those datasets.

Using these datasets, you could automatically fund [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization), member-owned communities, constructed by rules encoded in a computer program.
