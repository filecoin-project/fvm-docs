Some possibilities are:

- Auto-renewing deals: Without repeating data transfers when deals expire or get slashed.
- Self-repairing deals: If a provider has failed sectors and wants to recover the data, instead of having clients resend the data, replication workers can resend it automatically.
- Retrying deals: Where a client dispatches their deal data to a depot and, for a small fee, has the deal data transmitted and satisfactorily delivered to the provider.
