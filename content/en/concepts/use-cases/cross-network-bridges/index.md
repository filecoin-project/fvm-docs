title: "Cross-network bridges"
description: "The requirement for storage services is ubiquitious. No matter the chain, network, or application, through cross-network on-chain bridges, smart contracts on other chains would be able to access Filecoin storage in a trustless manner. Similarly, Filecoin actors would be able to interact with code on other chains, or generate proofs of Filecoin state or events that can be understood by counterparts such as Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, etc."

Building a suite of FVM actors that can process cryptographic primitives and data structures of other chains through IPLD (Interplanetary Linked Data) opens up the doors to a new generation of cross-chain web3 use cases. For example, NFT registries could prohibit transactions unless it can be proven that the underlying asset is stored on Filecoin, or rollup contracts could verify that the aggregator has stored transaction data in Filecoin.
