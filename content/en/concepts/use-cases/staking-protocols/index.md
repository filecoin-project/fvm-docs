With staking protocols, token holders can trustlessly pool their assets and set rules and terms by which storage providers (of any size) can permissionlessly access that liquidity.

Staking protocols can use on-chain data points (e.g. longevity of an address, history of slashing) to better assess risk and parameterize terms, while also allowing storage providers of all sizes to access capital.

This can help storage providers fund upfront capital costs like Filecoin Plus deal collateral, while giving staking pools access to yield potential.
